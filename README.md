# GTile

*This extension is still in development, bugs report and new features enhancement/suggestion are welcome.*

You like GNOME ? You like Tiling Window Manager ? You can now have the best of both worlds with **GTILE**, the GNOME tiling window manager extension. This extension provides all the features of a tiling window manager:
- Create new tile
- Move tile
- Resize tile
- Maximize tile
- Remove tile

**GTile** is **flexible** with its easily **customizable keybindings** and its wide option choices which let you build the tiling window manager you have always needed ! But no worry, if options and customizations frightened you, **GTile** is a ready to use extension. It **natively handles multiple monitors** setup without any setting.

*GNOME works with windows, do we really have tiles ?* Yes and... No. This extension keep GNOME Windows (we build and extension not a real window manager) but we worked to make it look as if you were dealing with real tiles ! You have the choice to **remove GTK top bar** (looks really like tile). This option is disabled by default because it can lead to missing buttons on some apps which put buttons on top bar. Be careful too if you have GTK themes which may override this option **or** may be overridden by this option.
